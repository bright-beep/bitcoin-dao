# Bitcoin-Powered Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a sophisticated Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) powered by Bitcoin, providing a robust framework for decentralized governance, treasury management, and collaborative decision-making.

## Features

### 1. Membership Management

- Join and leave the DAO
- Stake and unstake tokens
- Track member reputation and activity

### 2. Proposal System

- Create proposals with titles and descriptions
- Vote on proposals with weighted voting power
- Execute proposals based on majority consensus
- Time-limited proposal voting window

### 3. Treasury Management

- Donate tokens to the DAO treasury
- Track and manage treasury balance
- Transfer funds based on approved proposals

### 4. Reputation System

- Dynamic reputation tracking
- Reputation increases for active participation
- Automatic reputation decay for inactive members

### 5. Cross-DAO Collaboration

- Propose collaborations with other DAOs
- Accept and manage inter-DAO proposals

## Contract Functions

### Membership Functions

- `join-dao()`: Join the DAO as a new member
- `leave-dao()`: Withdraw membership
- `stake-tokens(amount)`: Stake tokens in the DAO
- `unstake-tokens(amount)`: Withdraw staked tokens

### Proposal Functions

- `create-proposal(title, description, amount)`: Create a new proposal
- `vote-on-proposal(proposal-id, vote)`: Vote on an existing proposal
- `execute-proposal(proposal-id)`: Execute a proposal after voting period

### Treasury Functions

- `donate-to-treasury(amount)`: Contribute tokens to DAO treasury
- `get-treasury-balance()`: Check current treasury balance

### Collaboration Functions

- `propose-collaboration(partner-dao, proposal-id)`: Propose collaboration with another DAO
- `accept-collaboration(collaboration-id)`: Accept a proposed collaboration

### Utility Functions

- `get-member-reputation(user)`: Retrieve a member's current reputation
- `decay-inactive-members()`: Reduce reputation for long-inactive members

## Reputation Mechanism

The contract implements a sophisticated reputation system:

- Members gain reputation by:
  - Creating proposals
  - Voting on proposals
  - Donating to the treasury
- Reputation decays for members inactive for more than 30 days
- Voting power is calculated based on reputation and staked tokens

## Collaboration Mechanism

The cross-DAO collaboration feature allows:

- Proposing collaborations between DAOs
- Tracking collaboration status
- Inter-DAO proposal sharing and acceptance

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:

- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized access attempt
- `ERR-ALREADY-MEMBER`: Membership duplicate prevention
- `ERR-NOT-MEMBER`: Non-member action prevention
- `ERR-INVALID-PROPOSAL`: Proposal validation
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS`: Treasury fund checks

## Security Considerations

- Membership required for most actions
- Proposal and voting time limits
- Reputation-based weighted voting
- Treasury fund validation
- Cross-checks before critical state changes

## Technical Details

- Platform: Stacks Blockchain
- Language: Clarity Smart Contract
- Token Type: Stacks Token (STX)
- Proposal Expiration: Approximately 10 days (1440 blocks)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks wallet
- Clarinet for local development and testing
- Basic understanding of DAO governance

### Deployment

1. Install Clarinet
2. Configure your Stacks environment
3. Deploy the contract using Clarinet
4. Initialize DAO by calling `join-dao()`
